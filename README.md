# Prediction Movie Success
This is a project based on predicting movie success. I have previous movie data. The data was cleaned and pre processed by me and done some EDA and analysis. Based on that i trained the models including Logistics regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, etc and conculsion were drawn in the end based of performance metrics.
Deployed the model on Render.com.
